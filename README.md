### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luca, a software developer with a backend focus.

I'm an individual contributor willing to keep that professional track. I work remotely since 2020.

I love following and chatting about software engineering practices like DDD and DevOps. Both involve customer-oriented thinking, attention to quality and constraints.

Typical duties and abilities 
* analyzing to understand the business value, the why behind a stakeholder need
  * ROI driven approach to my daily work
* discussing ideas and solutions with non-technical people, keeping the discussion in the "problem space"
* being proactive in incrementally improving the product and platform for the long-term
* collaborating with the team\peers
  * discussing business priorities
  * organizing work incrementally for a better time-to-market
  * aligning on common technical and non-technical goals
  * reviewing code
* writing code aiming at readability and maintainability
  * trunk-based\short-lived branches approach
  * CI/CD pipelines optimized for quick feedback
  * test-first, outside-in
  * simple design, KISS
  * domain-driven
* designing applications to improve resiliency and reduce coupling
  * event-driven
  * messaging
  * domain-oriented modules\services

I've worked mainly with Kotlin, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Grafana, Prometheus, MySQL and Postgres.
I've applied architectures and techniques in cloud-native applications like CI, CD, CQRS, Hexagonal Architecture, Test-Driven Development, Contract Testing, Infrastructure as code, and Event Sourcing.
