### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luca from Italy, a software developer with a backend focus.

I'm an individual contributor willing to keep that professional track. I work remotely since 2020.

This is what I care most about at this moment: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º https://mm.tt/map/2295410966?t=8ZuWxmJW7z

I love following and chatting about software engineering practices like DDD and DevOps. Both involve customer-oriented thinking, attention to quality and constraints.

Typical duties and abilities 
* analyzing to understand the business value, the why behind a stakeholder need
* discussing ideas and solutions with non-technical people, keeping the discussion in the "problem space"
* being proactive in incrementally improving the product and platform for the long-term
* collaborating with the team\peers
 * discussing business priorities
 * organizing work incrementally for a better time-to-market
 * aligning on common technical and non-technical goals
 * reviewing code
* writing code aiming at readability and maintainability
  * trunk-based or short-lived branches approach
  * quick feedback also thanks to CI/CD pipelines
  * test-first, outside-in
  * simple design, KISS
  * domain-driven
* designing applications to improve resiliency and reduce coupling
  * event-driven
  * messaging
  * domain-oriented

I've worked mainly with Kotlin, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Grafana, Prometheus, MySQL and Postgres.
And I've applied architectures and techniques in cloud-native applications like CI, CD, CQRS, Hexagonal Architecture, Test-Driven Development, Contract Testing, Infrastructure as code, and Event Sourcing.
